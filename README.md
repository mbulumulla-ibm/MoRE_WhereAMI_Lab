# How to demo Modernized Runtime Extension for Java End-to-End

## Objectives

In this exercise, you will learn how developers can use the **IBM Application Modernization Accelerator (AMA)** and the **IBM Application Modernization Accelerator Developer Tools (AMA Dev Tools)** to modernize an existing Java Enterprise Application for the target runtime **IBM Modernized Runtime Extension for Java (MoRE)**. 


The lab consists of four parts:

- Part 1: Use the **IBM Application Modernization Accelerator (AMA)** data collector 
	- Use the AMA data collector to scan the currentan application server landscape
- Part 2: Use the **IBM Application Modernization Accelerator (AMA)** Visualization and Assessment capabilities
	- Analyze one of the discovered applications using AMA
	- Create a migration plan
- Part 3: Use the **Application Modernization Accelerator Developer Tools (AMA Dev Tools)** to update the code
	- Review the modernization issues in the source code.
	- Apply automated fixed to resolve modernization issues
- Part 4: Deploy to **IBM Modernized Runtime Extension for Java (MoRE)**
	- Create a managed Liberty cluster
	- Deploy the modernized application

You will need an estimated **60 to 90 minutes** to complete all parts of the lab. But there is also a shortcut to skip a part.

At the end of this lab, you should be able to:

  - use Application Modernization Accelerator (AMA) to assess an application for target Modernized Runtime Extensions for Java (MoRE).
  - use Application Modernization Accelerator Development Tools (AMA Dev Tools) to modernize the application to make it work on MoRE.
  - create within a traditional WebSphere Application Cell a managed Liberty cluster and deploy the modernized application.
  

## Shortcut: 
To get a good overiew about the capabilities provided by the IBM solutions, it is recommended to do all parts in sequence. 

Nevertheless you can skip the one or other part of the lab. 
- You can start with part 2 (AMA Assessment) and skip the AMA data collection
- You can start with part 3 (AMA Dev Tools) and skip the AMA assessment
- You can start with part 4 (MoRE) and skip the assessment and modification of the application code

If you want to skip a part of the lab, there might be some additional steps to be done. Details on how to skip a lab can be found in the appendix in the section [Shortcut - How to](#shortcut---how-to-skip-parts-of-the-lab)

### Tips for working in the lab environment     

1. You can resize the viewable area using the **noVNC Settings** options to resize the virtual desktop to fit your screen.

    a. From the environment VM, click on the **twisty** on the noNC control pane to open the menu.  

    ![fit to window](./images/media/tz_z-twisty.png)

    b. To increase the visible area, click on `Settings > Scaling Mode` and set the value to `Remote Resizing`
      
     ![fit to window](./images/media/tz_z-remote-resize.png)


2.  You can copy / paste text from the lab guide into the lab environment using the clipboard in the noVNC viewer. 
   
    a. Copy the text from the lab guide that you want to paste into the lab environment
    
    b. Click the **Clipboard** icon and **paste** the text into the noVNC clipboard

    ![fit to window](./images/media/tz_paste.png)
    
    c. Paste the text into the VM, such as to a terminal window, browser window, etc. 

    d. Click on the **clipboard** icon again to close the clipboard

    > **NOTE:** Sometimes pasting into a Terminal window in the VM does not work consistently. 
    
    > In this case you might try again, or open another Terminal Window and try again, or  paste the text into a **Text Editor** in the VM and then paste it into the Terminal window in the VM. 


3. An alternative to using the noVNC Copy / Paste option, you may consider opening the lab guide in a web browser inside of the VM. Using this method, you can easily copy / paste text from the lab guide without having to use the noVNC clipboard.
